            I am mohnish. I have many hobbes . Some of them are: playing cricket , football ,carrom, chess ,ludo and cycling. But my most favourite hobby is reading . I love reading books on encyclopedias , amazing facts , stories like harry poter series , geronimo stilton series , science and space , mythologies and many many more. Reading books is not enough , you may also read news papers and magazines. I read books when i am going from and coming to school , at night and in free periods . It is so facinating to learn and know out of the world knowledge.

        There is no single definition of Science of reading (SOR). Foundational skills such as phonics (decoding) and phonemic awareness are considered to be important parts of the science of reading, but they are not the only ingredients. SOR includes any research and evidence about how humans learn to read, and how reading should be taught. This includes areas such as oral reading fluency, vocabulary, morphology, reading comprehension, text, spelling and pronunciation, thinking strategies, oral language proficiency, working memory training, and written language performance (e.g., cohesion, sentence combining/reducing).
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition, some educators feel that SOR should include digital literacy; background knowledge; content-rich instruction; infrastructural pillars (curriculum, reimagined teacher preparation, and leadership); adaptive teaching (recognizing the student's individual, culture and linguistic strengths); bi-literacy development; equity, social justice and supporting underserved populations (e.g., students from low-income backgrounds).
